# gGloboReactNative
This project is a React Native Project for creating a blog with React Native. The project uses React Native to connect 
with a Youtube API to fetch and read videos and a WordPress API to read blog posts. The project is based on the course 
"React Native Fundamentals" published in 2018 by Pluralsight. This project is an implementation of that pluralsight course 
with the new version of React Native, the version 0.68.
